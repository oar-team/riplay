   Synthetic Application for ESP2
   -------------------------------

   This application reads an elapsed time from the command
   line and executes for approximately that interval. For
   example,
               ./pchksum -t 100 -u 5000
   will run the application for 100 seconds, where the message passing
   will occur every 5 seconds. The only output will be the observed
   (internal) elapsed time and iteration count. Use "-v" flag to see
   more output, or "-h" for more usage options.


   Alternatively, the application can take an iteration 
   count instead of a run time, for example,
               ./pchksum -n 22000
   For an idea of the iteration count, see the line 
   "Iteration count:" in the verbose output.


   To use with the ESP test, run "pchksum" at the partition
   size from Table X and specify the run time using the 
   "-t" flag. Enter the observed elapsed wallclock time from 
   "/bin/time" into Table X. This time is used to compute the
   AMT. The output will contain an "Iteration count" field,
   use this integer to configure the scripts for each job
   type.
